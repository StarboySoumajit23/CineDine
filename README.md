This is a web app designed by me with the help of React.js and Vite
It is called CineDine
#Description of the Project
In CineDine there are unlimited movies which I have got accesed with the help of API from. Then I have implemented Debounce function to optimise search option and reduce load on API.
With the help of APPwrite we have also made a database to store the user's search.
